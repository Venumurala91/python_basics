# What is Python?
# Python is a popular high level programming language,object oriented,interpreted  and dynamically typed language . It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
#
#
# # Python is an object-oriented programming language because it uses classes and objects to define and manage data. This makes programs easier to understand and maintain.
# # How Python uses objects and classes
# #     Classes: blue print to create an object
# #     Objects:Instance of a class
# #         Represent real-world entities. Objects can have properties, methods, and types.
# #     Benefits of object-oriented programming
# #         Reusable code
# #         Child classes can inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, reducing duplication.
# #         Modular code
# #         Encapsulation bundles data and behaviors into classes, promoting modular code.
# #         Maintainable code
# #         Abstraction hides implementation details, making it easier to focus on what an object does.
#
# # why python is interpreted langauge :
# #     it executed the code line by line and throws error at runtime only so it is interpreted
# #
# # In other languages like java , c , c++ we can use compiler
# #     compiler will executes entire code and throws error at a time once all.
#
# # Python is dynamically typed language because : No need to declare data type while we are assigning values to a variable
#     # ex: In python
#     #     a=5    #not giving any data type
#     #     print(a)
#     # ex: In java
#     #     int a =5
#     #     system.print.ln(a)
#
#
#
# It is used for:
#
#             web development (server-side),
#             software development,
#             Data science , Machine learning
#             mathematics,
#             system scripting
#
#
#
# # what python do :
# #         Python is a versatile programming language used to build websites, analyze data, automate tasks, and more.
# #         It's a general-purpose language that's easy to learn and use, making it a good choice for beginners.

#
# # how python code executes in system or computer
#
#
# # python source code (first.py) --> Byte code(.pyc(compiled ))--machine code(10101100110)-->output(computer)
#
# # Why Python?
#     # Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
#     # Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
#     # Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
#     # Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
#     # Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
#
# print("Hello, World!")
# output: Hello, World!


#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables
# Variables are containers for storing data values.
